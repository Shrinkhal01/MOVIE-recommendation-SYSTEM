🎬 Movie Recommender System 📽️
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System, a machine learning-based project that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. 🚀

🌟 Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies by finding users with similar tastes.
User Input: Allows users to rate movies and receive custom recommendations.
Genre-Based Recommendations: Provides movie suggestions based on selected genres.
Error Handling: Deals with missing data and encoding errors, ensuring smooth execution.

🛠️ How It Works
Input: User rates a set of movies.
Data Processing: The system uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to analyze movie ratings from other users and generate a similarity matrix.
Output: Based on user input and similar users' preferences, the system recommends movies.


⚙️ Installation & Setup

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
NumPy 📊
